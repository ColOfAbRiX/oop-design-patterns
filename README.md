# OOP Design Patterns in Scala

Examples to teach OOP Design Patterns in Scala.

The patterns treated in this project are mostly the [Gang of Four Design
Patterns](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Design_Patterns).

This project was born out of necessity to teach design patterns and I decided to use an OOP-only
subset of Scala because I wanted a language on the JVM and the Scala syntax is clean and concise
and, despite being famous for FP, Scala can be used in a pure OOP style (although I couldn't resist
slipping in some FP bits).

During this project I found several useful resources online and one of my best finding is this
website about [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns).

The project includes the following patterns:

* Adapter pattern
* Builder pattern
* Composite pattern
* Decorator pattern
* Iterator pattern
* Observer pattern
* Proxy pattern
* Singleton pattern
* Strategy pattern

I've also added examples of some libraries for configuration, logging and testing.

For this I make use of the following libraries:

* PureConfig
* airframe-log
* ScalaTest and ScalaCheck
